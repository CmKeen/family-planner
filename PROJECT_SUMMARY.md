### Smart Planning Engine:

**Auto-Generation Algorithm:**
```
1. Fetch family's dietary profile
2. Get compliant recipes (kosher, halal, GF, LF, etc.)
3. Filter by allergies
4. Separate: favorites, novelties, others
5. Calculate meal counts (60-80% favorites, 1-2 novelties)
6. Get school menus for the week
7. For each day:
   - Check for school lunch
   - Select compliant lunch recipe
   - Select dinner avoiding school lunch category
8. Distribute favorites, novelties, and variety
9. Return 14 meals (7 days √ó 2 meals)
```

**Express Plan Algorithm:**
```
1. Get only favorite recipes
2. Require at least 1 favorite
3. Create week with only favorites
4. Add 1 random novelty
5. Return quick plan (< 5 min validation)
```

**Shopping List Algorithm:**
```
1. Aggregate all ingredients from weekly meals
2. Normalize quantities by unit
3. Adjust for portions and guests
4. Deduct from inventory (if tracked)
5. Group by store aisle/category
6. Round to packaging sizes (0.25kg, 50g, etc.)
7. Suggest dietary substitutions
8. Return sorted list
```

## üé® Screenshots (To Be Taken)

I haven't taken screenshots yet because I need to actually run the app with Docker.

To provide screenshots, I would need to:
1. Start the Docker containers
2. Register a user
3. Create a family
4. Generate a weekly plan
5. Use browser dev tools or Chrome MCP to capture screens

**Would you like me to do that now?**

3. **No Internationalization** - i18n setup exists but translations not added
4. **No Tests** - Unit/integration tests not written yet
5. **Basic Error Handling** - Could be more granular

### Next Steps (Priority Order):

**Phase 1: Complete Core UI**
1. Build full WeeklyPlanPage with meal grid
2. Build RecipesPage with filtering
3. Build ShoppingListPage with checkboxes
4. Add recipe detail modal
5. Add meal swap modal

**Phase 2: Polish**
1. Add loading states
2. Add error toast notifications
3. Add form validation feedback
4. Add empty states
5. Add onboarding tour

**Phase 3: V1.5 Features**
1. Collaboration UI (votes, RSVP)
2. Guest management interface
3. Wish list UI
4. Notifications
5. Cutoff and delta mode

**Phase 4: Testing & Deployment**
1. Write unit tests
2. Write integration tests
3. E2E tests with Playwright
4. Deploy to cloud (Railway/Render)
5. Set up CI/CD
