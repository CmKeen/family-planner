# üß™ Family Planner - Complete Testing Guide

## Quick Start Testing

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed
- Postman or curl (for API testing)
- Web browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)

---

## üê≥ Option 1: Docker Testing (Recommended)

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
cd /home/user/family-planner

# Start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Wait for services to be ready (30-60 seconds)
# You'll see: "Server is running on port 3001"
```

### 2. Verify Services

**Check Backend Health:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T..."
}
```

**Check Database:**
```bash
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U familyplanner -d family_planner -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"Recipe\";"
```

Expected: `8` (seed recipes)

**Check Frontend:**
Open: http://localhost:3000

---

## üìù Testing Workflows

### Workflow 1: User Registration & Authentication

  -d '{
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  }'
```

**Step 2: Create Family**
```
Family Name: The Doe Family
```

**Step 3: Submit**

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "The Doe Family",
    "dietProfile": {
      "kosher": true,
      "kosherType": "moderate",
      "meatToMilkDelayHours": 3,
      "glutenFree": false,
      "lactoseFree": false,
      "vegetarian": false,
      "vegan": false,
      "allergies": [],
      "favoriteRatio": 0.6,
      "maxNovelties": 2
    }
  }'
```

**Verify in Database:**
```bash
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U familyplanner -d family_planner -c "SELECT name, language FROM \"Family\";"
```

---

### Workflow 3: View Seed Recipes

**API Test: Get All Recipes**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/recipes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Get quick recipes (‚â§20 min)
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/recipes?maxTime=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Get kosher recipes
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/recipes?kosher=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

### Workflow 4: Auto-Generate Weekly Plan

**Frontend Test:**
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Click "New Plan" button
3. Wait for generation
4. Should redirect to plan view with 14 meals

**API Test:**
```bash
FAMILY_ID="your-family-uuid"
WEEK_START="2025-10-27T00:00:00.000Z"

curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/weekly-plans/$FAMILY_ID/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"weekStartDate\": \"$WEEK_START\"}"
```

**Verify Plan Contains:**
- 14 meals (7 days √ó 2 meals)
- Each meal has: dayOfWeek, mealType, recipeId, portions
- ~60-80% from favorites (if favorites marked)
- 1-2 novelties
- Recipe details populated

**Check in Database:**
```bash
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U familyplanner -d family_planner -c "SELECT * FROM \"WeeklyPlan\" WHERE \"familyId\" = 'your-family-uuid';"

docker-compose exec postgres psql -U familyplanner -d family_planner -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"Meal\" WHERE \"weeklyPlanId\" = 'your-plan-uuid';"
```

Expected meal count: 14

---

### Workflow 5: Express Plan Generation

**Test Marking Favorites First:**
```bash
# Mark a recipe as favorite
RECIPE_ID="recipe-uuid"

curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/recipes/$RECIPE_ID/favorite" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Generate Express Plan:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/weekly-plans/$FAMILY_ID/generate-express" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"weekStartDate\": \"2025-11-03T00:00:00.000Z\"}"
```

**Verify:**
- All meals except 1 should be favorites
- 1 meal should be a novelty
- Faster generation than auto plan

---

### Workflow 6: Meal Swapping

**Get Plan Meals:**
```bash
PLAN_ID="your-plan-uuid"

curl "http://localhost:3001/api/weekly-plans/$PLAN_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Swap a Meal:**
```bash
MEAL_ID="meal-uuid-to-swap"
NEW_RECIPE_ID="different-recipe-uuid"

curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/weekly-plans/$PLAN_ID/meals/$MEAL_ID/swap" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"newRecipeId\": \"$NEW_RECIPE_ID\"}"
```

**Verify:**
- Meal now has new recipe
- Portions remain same
- Other meals unchanged

---

### Workflow 7: Adjust Portions

**Update Meal Portions:**
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:3001/api/weekly-plans/$PLAN_ID/meals/$MEAL_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"portions": 6}'
```

**Verify:**

  -d '{
    "name": "Emily Doe",
    "role": "CHILD",
    "age": 8,
    "portionFactor": 0.7,
    "aversions": ["broccoli", "mushrooms"],
    "favorites": ["pizza", "pasta"]

  -d '{
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "role": "PARENT",
    "age": 35,
    "portionFactor": 1.0
  }'
```

**Verify:**

## üìù Known Issues

### Current Limitations
1. **Prisma Binary Download** - May fail in restricted networks
2. **No Email Verification** - Users can register without email confirmation
3. **No Rate Limiting** - API open to abuse
4. **No Pagination** - Large lists may be slow
5. **No Caching** - Redis not implemented
6. **Placeholder Pages** - WeeklyPlan, Recipes, ShoppingList UIs incomplete

### Workarounds
1. Use `PRISMA_ENGINES_CHECKSUM_IGNORE_MISSING=1`
2. Implement email service in production
3. Add rate limiting middleware
4. Add pagination to list endpoints
5. Add Redis for caching
6. Complete UI pages

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

After successful testing:
1. Complete remaining UI pages
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Add email notifications
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline
6. Deploy to staging environment
7. Conduct user acceptance testing
8. Deploy to production

---

## üìû Support

If tests fail:
1. Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
2. Check database: `docker-compose exec postgres psql ...`
3. Restart services: `docker-compose restart`
4. Full reset: `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up --build`
5. Check API health: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
